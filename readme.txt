== Description ==

= WP Revenue Booster =

Imagine walking into any store and talking to a salesperson who forgets everything they know about you, just seconds after they ask you about it.

That's your website right now!

But it doesn't have to be for much longer thanks to WP Revenue Booster!

Depending on where your customer is coming from, or what they've done on your site, now you can personalize their experience. Improve your site's conversions by simply making small tweaks in the way you write your offers and products - based on who is visiting. Amazon ran more than 300 tests on their thank you page to determine the best way to encourage post-purchase activity. Now you can too!
