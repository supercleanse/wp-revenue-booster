Dynamically personalize any text on your site based on your users' behavior.

== Description ==

= WP Revenue Booster =

Imagine walking into any store and talking to a salesperson who forgets everything they know about you, just seconds after they ask you about it.

That's your website right now!

But it doesn't have to be for much longer thanks to WP Revenue Booster!

Depending on where your customer is coming from, or what they've done on your site, now you can personalize their experience. Improve your site's conversions by simply making small tweaks in the way you write your offers and products - based on who is visiting. Amazon ran more than 300 tests on their thank you page to determine the best way to encourage post-purchase activity. Now you can too!

= Process =

1. Review where your traffic comes from so that you can determine what kind of segments to create.
2. Click on the screen and change the text - connecting it to the segment you've defined.
3. You can easily compare how each personalization change is impacting your revenue.
4. Iterate until you're happy with how much more money your site is making you.

= Getting Started =

- Step 1: Set up your Segments

Segments are the mechanism that WP Revenue Booster uses to determine who will be shown what text. Some examples could include "Returning Visitors", "Visitors from Canada", "Logged In Users", "Mobile Users", etc.

- Step 2: Customize Text on your Site

WP Revenue Booster makes it easy for you to add text customizations based on Segment. As a logged-in user just visit any page on your site, hover over the text you'd like to customize by segment and click it. Add the text you'd like to appear to any segments you've previously set up. That's it!

- Step 3: Test your Customizations

The best way to test your text customizations is by visiting your site as a user in the segment. For instance if your customization should show for mobile users try visiting the page from your phone or if you're targeting users from a different country, use a VPN server in that country to check the text customizations. There are more sophisticated tools to simulate requests that would work for your targeted requests but this is the simplest.
